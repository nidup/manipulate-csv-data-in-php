Tutorial and examples on [How to Manipulate CSV Files in PHP](https://www.nidup.io/blog/manipulate-csv-files-in-php) and [How to Manipulate Excel Files in PHP](https://www.nidup.io/blog/manipulate-excel-files-in-php).

## Installation üì¶

Download the source code:

```
git clone git@github.com:nidup/manipulate-csv-data-in-php.git
cd manipulate-csv-data-in-php
```

Then the installation comes into 2 flavors, directly on your host or using docker.

Once installed the commands are the same, some docker shortcuts are provided in `.docker/bin`. 

### Install directly on your system (option A) üíª

Install the PHP dependencies: 

```
composer install
```

### Install with docker & docker-compose (option B) üêã

Build the docker image and install the PHP dependencies:

```
docker-compose up -d 
.docker/bin/composer install
```

## Use the console commands üöÄ

Use `bin/console` or `.docker/bin/console` to launch a command.

List the commands:
```
bin/console --env=prod
